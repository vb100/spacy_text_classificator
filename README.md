```
<p>It will take 10-20 seconds to install them.</p>

<p>Also, for this tutorial we use the standard Spacy universal English language model (small version). You can download and install it by running the following command in your terminal:</p>

```bash
python3 -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

<p>This model will act as a base model we will tune from with our custom train set.</p>
