<li><a href="https://github.com/huggingface/setfit">Spacy SetFit</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You can install these Python packages directly in your terminal with the followin command:</p>

```bash
pip install spacy spacy-setfit
```
<p>It will take 10-20 seconds to install them.</p>

<p>Also, for this tutorial we use the standard Spacy universal English language model (small version). You can download and install it by running the following command in your terminal:</p>

```bash
python3 -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

<p>This model will act as a base model we will tune from with our custom train set.</p>

<p>Also, we use Transform released by HuggingFace, and named <b>paraphrase-MiniLM-L3-v2</b> which maps our text into tokens. You can read more about this tokenizer <a href="https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/paraphrase-MiniLM-L3-v2">here</a>.</p>
